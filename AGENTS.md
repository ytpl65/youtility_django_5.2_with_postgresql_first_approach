# AGENTS.md - ChatGPT Codex Agent Integration Guide for Django 5 Projects

## Purpose

This guide outlines the roles, responsibilities, and activation prompts for Codex agents designed to support development, testing, review, and optimization in a Django 5-based, multi-app project using GraphQL and REST components.

## Project Snapshot

* **Framework**: Django 5
* **Architecture**: GraphQL-first with complementary REST endpoints
* **Validation**: Pydantic for schema and input validation
* **Structure**: Modular, multi-app layout (e.g., `service`, `auth`, `core`)
* **Testing Frameworks**: `pytest-django`, `factory_boy`, `coverage`
